<h3>Ratatoiulle</h3>

<p>For me this one is my favorite, well in case of cartoons, or animated because for me I really enjoy when people cook or do something
    creative, so it motivates me to find to things to be passionte especially with "Anyone can cook" even a rat!

<h3>Good Fellas</h3>

<p>This movie is one of my favorite Mob movies of all time, maybe even more than The GodFather, because it give us a perspective of 
    he entered the mafia world, then how he was on top of the world to just to the falldown of the protagonist.

<h3>Whiplash</h3>

<p>A really interesting movie in which the protagonist gives his 120% of ability to play the drums but the "antagonist" that at the end
    of the day was just a really invested musician that wanted perfection.
